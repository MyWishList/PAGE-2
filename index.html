    <p>Apple TV is a digital media player and microconsole developed and sold by Apple Inc. It is a small network appliance and entertainment device that can receive digital data for visual and audio content such as music, video, video games, or the screen display of certain other devices, and play it on a connected television set or other video display. <br> <br> 

Apple TV is an HDMI-compliant source device.<br>
To use it for viewing, it has to be connected to an enhanced-definition or high-definition widescreen television via an HDMI cable.<br> 
The device has no integrated controls and can only be controlled remotely, either by an Apple Remote or Siri Remote control device (which is included with Apple TV) using its infrared/Bluetooth capability, by the Apple TV Remote app (downloadable from App Store) on numerous Apple devices using its Wi-Fi capability, or by some third-party gaming controllers and infrared remotes.<br> <br>

Apple TV runs software applications preinstalled with the system software or, for models running tvOS, downloaded from Apple's tvOS App Store over the device's Wi-Fi connection, with the most popular being those that stream video.<br>
[8] Major online content sources for Apple TV apps include subscription services for streaming television and film, cable and broadcast networks via TV Everywhere, and major sports leagues.[citation needed]<br><br>

Its Wi-Fi capability is also used to receive content purchased or rented directly from Apple's iTunes Store, transmitted from other nearby iDevices via AirPlay, or shared from macOS or Windows computers running iTunes.[citation needed]<br><br>

According to observers, Apple's March 2019 special event highlighted the company's reorientation of its focus away from the Apple TV hardware, which has lagged competitors with only 13% of U.S. connected TV market share, and apps on the set-top box, and toward higher revenue Apple-distributed video streaming that will be available even through competitors' devices, via the company's Apple TV+ original content service and Apple TV Channels a la carte premium video on demand subscription aggregating service</p><br><br><br>
